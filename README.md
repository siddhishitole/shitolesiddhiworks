During the preparation for an internship search, Siddhi Shitole engaged in a series of unique projects that leveraged her computer science knowledge in creative and practical ways. These projects not only honed her technical skills but also provided her with real-world experience that proved valuable in her later internship. Here is an elaboration on the projects:

1. Cloud Cover App for Analyzing Weather Reports
Overview: Siddhi developed a cloud cover app that analyzed weather reports to provide users with detailed information about cloud patterns, types, and coverage over a specific area. This app aimed to help users understand weather conditions better by visualizing data in an intuitive and accessible format.

2. Sonnet Generator
Overview: Siddhi worked on a Sonnet Generator, a natural language processing (NLP) project that could generate poetic compositions following the structure and style of traditional sonnets. The project involved creating an AI model capable of understanding meter, rhyme schemes, and thematic elements typical of sonnets.

3. Text Segmentation
Overview: This project focused on the segmentation of textual data into meaningful sections, such as sentences, paragraphs, or topics, which is crucial for applications like summarization, indexing, and document classification. The objective was to build a robust system that could intelligently segment text based on context and structure.
